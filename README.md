# Flask-voting-app-for-IPL-teams
A sample web poll application written in Python (Flask).
Users will be prompted with a poll question and related options. They can vote preferred option(s) and see poll results as a chart. Poll results are then loaded into an internal DB based on sqlite. As alternative, the application can store poll results in an external MySQL database.

Install the dependencies

    pip install flask
    pip install flask-sqlalchemy
    pip install mysql-python

and start the application

    python app.py
    Check if a poll already exists into db
    * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

 Happy polling!
