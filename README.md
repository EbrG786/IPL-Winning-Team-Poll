# Flask-voting-app-for-IPL-teams
A sample web poll application written in Python (Flask).
Users will be prompted with a poll question and related options. They can vote preferred option(s) and see poll results as a chart. Poll results are then loaded into an internal DB based on sqlite. As alternative, the application can store poll results in an external MySQL database.
